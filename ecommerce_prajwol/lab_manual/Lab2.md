# Ecommerce: Lab 2
Objectives: <br>
- To add brand model and category model <br>
- To enable and check CRUD operation in brand and category model in admin interface <br>

## Procedure: <br>
1. The first step we did was to create an ER Diagram to enhace the product_module to comply with the addition of categorys and brand. <br>
2. Then we added codes for Brand model and Category model in models.py. <br>
3. Then the database configuration is done which is by default sqlite3. <br>
4. After that we run python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate to persist the changes to database. <br>
5. Finally we tested the interface to verify the CRUD operation for brand, category and product. <br>

## Conclusion:<br>
In this lab we learned how to add new models in the interface. We added new models i.e brand and category in models.py.
We also made database configurations and made migrations to persist the change to the database and test
CRUD operations in the those new models.
